# Linearized-LTI-Modeling-and-Feedback-Control-of-a-2D-Drone-Delivery-Prototype

- The system being modeled and controlled is a drone/aerial package delivery concept. The model is a simplified 2D version of the system dynamics where state space and feedback control techniques are applied. A closed-loop design case study is performed as well. 

- Further implementation of LQR and the simulation is done in another repository.
